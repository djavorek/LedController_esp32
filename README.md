# LedController_esp32

ESP32 (Arduino) sketch to control Analog (5050) LED Strip on LAN through UDP protocol with simple string commands.

Don't copy any line of this project as a good example. It's just a home project, to provide useful foundation for my frontend and mobile application development practicing.
It works perfectly for me, but its hard to maintain and quite chaotic.

I appreciate all pull requests (it's my one and only C / Arduino project).
If you have any question, feel free to ask!
