# LedController_esp32
ESP32 (Arduino) sketch to control Analog (5050) LED Strip on LAN through Udp with simple strings

Don't copy any line from this project as a good example. It is a home project, it works perfectly for me, but its hard to maintain and quite chaotic.

I appreciate all pull requests (it's my one and only C / Arduino project).
If you have any question, feel free to ask!
